# Rova Movement Contract

## Overview

This is the contract to facilitate payment on Movement for a token sale.

## How it works

Users fund the network MOVE token to participate in the sale. Participation is associated with an identifier to correlate with Rova backend.

Requests to fund the sale are required to include a signature that is generated by Rova keys who have been granted the signer role. This ensures that the user has the right to participate in the sale (e.g. KYC and other limitations) and allows us to verify the token amount and payment amount.

## Roles

- `manager`: Can pause the sale and change the sale period.
- `signer`: Can sign off on funding requests.
- `withdrawal`: Can update the withdrawal address.
